RESILIENT STEGANOGRAPHY (RUST)

A high-performance steganographic tool designed to establish a robust plausible deniability ecosystem.

Unlike traditional LSB tools that hide a message in a single file, this solution fragments encrypted data across a chain of images, mixes them with mathematically indistinguishable "decoys," and sanitizes file system metadata to thwart forensic analysis.

ABSTRACT

In digital surveillance scenarios, traditional cryptography conceals the content but reveals the existence of a secret. This tool solves that problem by integrating Authenticated Encryption (AES-256-GCM) with a logical chaining protocol.

Key Capabilities:

Fragmentation: Splits large files across multiple image containers.

Chaining Protocol: Creates a hidden "Linked List" in the file system. Each image contains a pointer to the next, but only the holder of the key can traverse it.



Decoy Injection: Generates fake images filled with cryptographic noise. These are statistically indistinguishable from images containing real data.


Anti-Forensics: Automatically scrambles file creation order and sanitizes metadata (timestamps) to destroy chronological evidence.


ARCHITECTURE

The Chain Protocol Instead of a monolithic file, the payload is compressed (LZMA), encrypted, and sliced into chunks. A "ChainHeader" is embedded in every image. The header contains:


chunk_len: Size of the data in the current image.

has_next: Boolean flag indicating if there is more data.

next_filename: Points to the next random filename in the sequence.

sequence_number: Ensures correct ordering.


This allows the output directory to contain files with completely random names (e.g., "a7x9.png", "b2k1.png") with no visible sequence.

Plausible Deniability (Decoys) To make forensic analysis prohibitive, the system uses a Random Sampling with Replacement model. It can recycle a small pool of source images to generate thousands of output images.

Real Data: AES-256 encrypted chunks (Max Entropy).

Decoys: Random data generated by a CSPRNG (Max Entropy).

To an observer without the key, the real files and decoys are mathematically identical.

INSTALLATION

Ensure you have Rust installed. Command: cargo build --release The binary will be located at: ./target/release/esteganografia.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

Hide Data (Create the Chain) Compresses, encrypts, and hides a file inside a directory of images.

Command format: ./target/release/esteganografia hide --input-dir "[IMAGE_FOLDER]" --file "[FILE_TO_HIDE]" --output-dir "[OUTPUT_FOLDER]" --password "[PASSWORD]" --bits 2

input-dir: A folder containing clean images (PNG/JPG/etc) to be used as carriers.

bits: (Optional) Number of LSB bits to use (Default: 2). Note: The tool effectively performs "Infinite Recycling," reusing source images as needed to fit the payload.

Generate Decoys (Obfuscation) Floods the directory with fake files to hide the real chain.

Command format: ./target/release/esteganografia decoys --input-dir "[IMAGE_FOLDER]" --output-dir "[OUTPUT_FOLDER]" --bits 2

This will create dummy files that look exactly like the real data containers. It also triggers the metadata sanitizer to shuffle timestamps.


Scan & Recover If you have a folder full of random files and don't know which one is the start of the chain, use the scan mode.

Command format: ./target/release/esteganografia scan --dir "[OUTPUT_FOLDER]" --password "[PASSWORD]"

The scanner attempts to decrypt the header of every image. If it finds a valid ChainHeader with sequence_number 0, it automatically begins recovery.


Direct Recovery If you already know the starting image:

Command format: ./target/release/esteganografia recover --input-img "[PATH_TO_FIRST_IMAGE]" --password "[PASSWORD]"

SECURITY FEATURES

Confidentiality: AES-256-GCM. Keys derived via SHA-256.


Integrity: GCM Auth Tag ensures images haven't been tampered with. Corruption results in immediate failure.

Visual Stealth: Uses LSB (Least Significant Bit) embedding (1-2 bits) to remain invisible to the naked eye.

Metadata Wipe: Scrambles Creation and Modification timestamps to prevent timeline analysis.

Ordering: Physically deletes and re-writes files in random order to reset file system indexes.
